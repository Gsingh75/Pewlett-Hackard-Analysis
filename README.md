# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

We tend to help Bobby’s manager in order to prepare for the upcoming “silver tsunami” as many of the current employees are soon to reach retirement age, and perform the following tasks:

1. Firstly, by determining the number of retiring employees per title.
2. Secondly, by identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
3. Thirdly, by writing a report that summarizes our analysis.

## Results:
Using the retirement_titles.csv, there are 133776 rows that contain all the titles of employees, born between 1952 and 1955. There are some duplicate entries for some employees, because they have switched titles over the years.

There are 72,458 unique employees, using the unique_titles.csv that have rearched the retirment age and who were born between '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31'.
