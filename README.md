# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

We tend to help Bobby’s manager in order to prepare for the upcoming “silver tsunami” as many of the current employees are soon to reach retirement age, and perform the following tasks:

1. determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
3. write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami”
